Socket Programming

Build a client-server socket program with the client making chat to the server. The protocol between the client and server is given by the following:

Server is first started on a known port.

Client program is started next and the client connects to server which then

asks the user for input.

User message is typed on the terminal such as ‘Hello:Roll Number’

(your individual number) and user input is sent to the server through

the socket connected.

The server reads user’s input from the client socket and checks whether the roll number is indeed his/hers. If the user has typed message ‘Hello:xxxxxxxxx’ correctly - with the student's correct roll number, the server must reply with ‘This number belongs to NITC S6/S8 batch’. For any other message server must reply with ‘Ok’.

Client then reads the reply from the server and checks it -  either it is ‘This number belongs to NITC S6/S8 batch’ or ‘Ok’.

If the user had typed ‘Hello:Roll Number’ and server had replied with ‘This number belongs to NITC S6/S8 batch’, client quits correctly. Otherwise the client asks the user for the next message to be sent to the server.

You must solve this assignment individually. 

Coding must be done in C and the file compiled using gcc in Ubuntu.

You must submit a single file containing both client and server side code in eduserver. Name the file as <student first name>-2A.c
